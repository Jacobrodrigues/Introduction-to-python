# Exercise Extend a list
''' Finally, you can also remove elements from your list. You can do this with the del statement:
    
    x = ["a","b","c","d"]
    del(x[1])
    
    Pay attention here: as soon as you remove an element from a list, the indexes of the elements that come after the deleted element all change!
    
    The updated and extended version of areas that you've built in the previous exercises is coded below. 
    You can copy and paste this into the IPython Shell to play around with the result.
    
    areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0,
        "chill zone", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75,
         "bathroom", 10.50, "poolhouse", 24.5,
         "garage", 15.45]
    
    The ; sign is used to place commands on the same line. The following two code chunks are equivalent:
    # Same line
        command1; command2

    # Separate lines
        command1
        command2
    
    Which of the code chunks will do the job for us?
